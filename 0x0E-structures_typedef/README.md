# 0x0E - Structures, typedef


This repository contains exercises and code examples related to structures in the C programming language.

Structures in C provide a way to group related data items together under a single name. They allow you to define a custom data type that consists of various members with different data types. Structures are commonly used to organize and represent complex data structures, group related variables, and manipulate them as a single entity.

## Requirements

-   Editors: vi, vim, emacs
    
-   All the files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    
-   All codes are using the Betty style.
    
-   Global variables are not allowed.
    
-   No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
-   The standard library is allowed.

-   The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function  `_putchar`  will be included in a header file called  `main.h`
    

## Mandatory Tasks

- [x] 0. Poppy:

	Define a new type `struct dog` with the following elements:

	-   `name`, type = `char *`
	-   `age`, type = `float`
	-   `owner`, type = `char *`
	
- [x] 1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself : 

	Write a function that initialize a variable of type `struct dog`

	-   Prototype: `void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner);`

- [x] 2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad : 

	Write a function that prints a `struct dog`

	-   Prototype: `void print_dog(struct dog *d);`
	-   Format: see example bellow
	-   You are allowed to use the standard library
	-   If an element of `d` is `NULL`, print `(nil)` instead of this element. (if `name` is `NULL`, print `Name: (nil)`)
	-   If `d` is `NULL` print nothing.

- [x] 3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read: 

	Define a new type `dog_t` as a new name for the type `struct dog`.

- [x] 4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of:
		
	Write a function that creates a new dog.

	-   Prototype: `dog_t *new_dog(char *name, float age, char *owner);`
	-   You have to store a copy of `name` and `owner`
	-   Return `NULL` if the function fails

- [x] 5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg:
		
	Write a function that frees dogs.

	-   Prototype: `void free_dog(dog_t *d);`
