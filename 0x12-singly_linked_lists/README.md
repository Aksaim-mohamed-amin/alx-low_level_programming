# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

In this project, we will be exploring the concept of singly linked lists in C programming language. Singly linked lists are a type of data structure where each element in the list contains a pointer to the next element in the list. This allows for efficient traversal of the list, but makes random access to elements more difficult.

## Getting Started

Before starting this module, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of computer programming concepts, including basic syntax, data types, and control flow statements. Additionally, you should have some familiarity with C programming concepts, including variable types, functions, and the use of the gcc compiler.

## Project Requirements

-   Editors: vi, vim, emacs
    
-   All the files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    
-   All codes are using the Betty style.
    
-   Global variables are not allowed.
    
-   No more than 5 functions per file.
    
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
    

## Mandatory Tasks

- [x] 0. Print list :
    
	Write a function that prints all the elements of a  `list_t`  list.

	-   Prototype:  `size_t print_list(const list_t *h);`
	-   Return: the number of nodes
	-   Format: see example
	-   If  `str`  is  `NULL`, print  `[0] (nil)`
	-   You are allowed to use  `printf`

    
-  [x] 1. List length:
    
	  Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked  `list_t`  list.

	-   Prototype:  `size_t list_len(const list_t *h);`
    
- [x]  2. Add node :
    
	 Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a  `list_t`  list.

	-   Prototype:  `list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);`
	-   Return: the address of the new element, or  `NULL`  if it failed
	-   `str`  needs to be duplicated
	-   You are allowed to use  `strdup`
	
    
- [x]  3. Add node at the end :
    
	 Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a  `list_t`  list.

	-   Prototype:  `list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);`
	-   Return: the address of the new element, or  `NULL`  if it failed
	-   `str`  needs to be duplicated
	-   You are allowed to use  `strdup`
    
- [x]  4. Free list :
    
	 Write a function that frees a  `list_t`  list.

	-   Prototype:  `void free_list(list_t *head);`
    

## Optional Tasks

- [x] 5. The Hare and the Tortoise:
    
	Write a function that prints  `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n`  before the  `main`  function is executed.

	-   You are allowed to use the  `printf`  function
        
- [x] 6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language :
   
	Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints  `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line.

	-   You are only allowed to use the  `printf`  function
	-   You are not allowed to use interrupts
	-   Your program will be compiled using  `nasm`  and  `gcc`:  
	- nasm -f elf64 101-hello_holberton.asm && gcc -no-pie -std=gnu89 101-hello_holberton.o -o hello (will be used to compail the programe).
