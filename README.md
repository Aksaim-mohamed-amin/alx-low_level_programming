#ALX Low-Level Programming with C

This folder contains the tasks and exercises for learning the low-levelprogramming language C as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.
The materials are designed to start from the very beginning, assuming no prior programming experience, and progress gradually to more advanced concepts.

##Getting Started

Before beginning this course, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of computer fundamentals, including hardware and software concepts, and the ability to use a command-line interface. Additionally, you will need a C compiler installed on your computer.

All the files in this folder will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89. I will be using VI and EMACS as a text editors.

I will also be using the Betty style for all my C code. You can find more information about the Betty style in [Here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

##Task Structure

The tasks are organized into modules, each covering a specific topic in C programming. Each module contains:

- A README.md file that provides an overview of the topics covered and the learning objectives
+ A set of exercises that will help you practice the concepts covered in the module

The tasks are designed to be challenging, and it is recommended that you attempt to complete them on your own before referring to the provided solutions.
