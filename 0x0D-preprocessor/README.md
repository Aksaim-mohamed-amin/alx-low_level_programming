# 0x0D - Preprocessor


This repository focuses on the C preprocessor, a powerful tool that runs before compilation to perform tasks such as macro expansion, file inclusion, and conditional compilation. The preprocessor helps with code reusability, modularity, and platform-specific code

## Requirements

-   Editors: vi, vim, emacs
    
-   All the files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    
-   All codes are using the Betty style.
    
-   Global variables are not allowed.
    
-   No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
-   The standard library is allowed.

-   The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function  `_putchar`  will be included in a header file called  `main.h`
    

## Mandatory Tasks

- [x] 0. Object-like Macro:

	Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

- [x] 1. Pi : 

	Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

- [x] 2. File name : 

	Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

	-   You are allowed to use the standard library

- [x] 3. Function-like macro : 

	Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

- [x] 4. SUM:
		
	Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
