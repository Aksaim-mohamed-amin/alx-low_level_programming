# 0x0B - malloc, free


This project introduces the concepts of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in the C programming language using the `malloc` and `free` functions. Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to request memory dynamically at runtime, enabling flexible memory management.

## Requirements

-   Editors: vi, vim, emacs
    
-   All the files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    
-   All codes are using the Betty style.
    
-   Global variables are not allowed.
    
-   No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
-   The standard library is allowed.

-   The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function  `_putchar`  will be included in a header file called  `main.h`
    

## Mandatory Tasks

- [x] 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee : 

	Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

	-   Prototype: `char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);`
	-   Returns `NULL` if size = `0`
	-   Returns a pointer to the array, or `NULL` if it fails

- [x] 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings : 

	Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

	-   Prototype: `char *_strdup(char *str);`
	-   The `_strdup()` function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string `str`. Memory for the new string is obtained with `malloc`, and can be freed with `free`.
	-   Returns `NULL` if str = NULL
	-   On success, the `_strdup` function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns `NULL` if insufficient memory was available

	FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strdup`. Run `man strdup` to learn more.

- [x] 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life : 

   Write a function that concatenates two strings.

	-   Prototype: `char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2);`
	-   The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of `s1`, followed by the contents of `s2`, and null terminated
	-   if `NULL` is passed, treat it as an empty string
	-   The function should return `NULL` on failure

- [x] 3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize : 

	Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

	-   Prototype: `int **alloc_grid(int width, int height);`
	-   Each element of the grid should be initialized to `0`
	-   The function should return `NULL` on failure
	-   If `width` or `height` is `0` or negative, return `NULL`

- [x] 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up :
	
	Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function.

	-   Prototype: `void free_grid(int **grid, int height);`
	-   Note that we will compile with your `alloc_grid.c` file. Make sure it compiles.

## Optional Tasks

- [x] 5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe : 

	Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

	-   Prototype: `char *argstostr(int ac, char **av);`
	-   Returns `NULL` if `ac == 0` or `av == NULL`
	-   Returns a pointer to a new string, or `NULL` if it fails
	-   Each argument should be followed by a `\n` in the new string

- [x] 6. I will show you how great I am : 

	Write a function that splits a string into words.

	-   Prototype: `char **strtow(char *str);`
	-   The function returns a pointer to an array of strings (words)
	-   Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated
	-   The last element of the returned array should be `NULL`
	-   Words are separated by spaces
	-   Returns `NULL` if `str == NULL` or `str == ""`
	-   If your function fails, it should return `NULL`
