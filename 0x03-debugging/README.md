# 0x03 Debugging

This repository contains assignments for learning how to debug programs in C.

## Getting Started

Before starting this module, you should have a basic understanding of computer programming concepts and should have some familiarity with C programming concepts.

## Debugging Tools

In order to debug the programs, you will be using `gcc` compiler with options `-g` and `-Wall`. Additionally, you can use the following tools:

-   `gdb`: a powerful command-line debugger that allows you to run programs with breakpoints, examine variables, and step through code one line at a time.
-   `valgrind`: a tool that helps you detect memory management problems in your programs.
-   `printf`: a simple yet powerful debugging tool that allows you to print out variables and other information as your program runs.

## Project Requirements

-   All programs should compile without any warnings or errors.
-   Your code should follow the `Betty` style.
-   All functions must be thoroughly tested.
-   Programs should be able to take different inputs and produce the expected output.

## List of tasks

- [x]  0. Multiple mains :
	- create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`
    
- [x]  1. Like, comment, subscribe :
	- Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
			
			#include <stdio.h>

			/**
			* main - causes an infinite loop
			* Return: 0
			*/

			int main(void)
			{
			        int i;

			        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

			        i = 0;

			        while (i < 10)
			        {
			                putchar(i);
			        }

			        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

			        return (0);
			}
- [x]  2. 0 > 972? : 
	- Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

			#include "main.h"

			/**
			 * largest_number - returns the largest of 3 numbers
			 * @a: first integer
			 * @b: second integer
			 * @c: third integer
			 * Return: largest number
			 */

			int largest_number(int a, int b, int c)
			{
			    int largest;

			    if (a > b && b > c)
			    {
			        largest = a;
			    }
			    else if (b > a && a > c)
			    {
			        largest = b;
			    }
			    else
			    {
			        largest = c;
			    }

			    return (largest);
			}
	    
- [x] 3. Leap year: 


This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

- Fix the  `print_remaining_days()`  function so that the output works correctly for  _all_  dates and  _all_  leap years.
-   Line count will not be checked for this task.
-   You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of  `month`  will never be less than  `1`  or greater than  `12`) and valid days (i.e. the value of  `day`  will never be less than  `1`  or greater than  `31`).
-   You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).

	-   3-main_a.c

		```
		#include <stdio.h>
		#include "main.h"

		/**
		* main - takes a date and prints how many days are left in the year, taking
		* leap years into account
		* Return: 0
		*/

		{
		    int month;
		    int day;
		    int year;

		    month = 4;
		    day = 01;
		    year = 1997;

		    printf("Date: %02d/%02d/%04d\n", month, day, year);

		    day = convert_day(month, day);

		    print_remaining_days(month, day, year);

		    return (0);
		}
		```

	- 3-convert_day.c
		```
		#include "main.h"

		/**
		* convert_day - converts day of month to day of year, without accounting
		* for leap year
		* @month: month in number format
		* @day: day of month
		* Return: day of year
		*/

		            break;
		        case 8:
		            day = 212 + day;
		            break;
		        case 9:
		            day = 243 + day;
		            break;
		        case 10:
		            day = 273 + day;
		            break;
		        case 11:
		            day = 304 + day;
		            break;
		        case 12:
		            day = 334 + day;
		            break;
		        default:
		            break;
		    }
		    return (day);
		}
		```

		* left in the year, taking leap years into account
		* @month: month in number format
		* @day: day of month
		* @year: year
		* Return: void
		*/

		void print_remaining_days(int month, int day, int year)
		{
		    if ((year % 4 == 0 || year % 400 == 0) && !(year % 100 == 0))
		    {
		        if (month >= 2 && day >= 60)
		        {
		            day++;
		        }

		        printf("Day of the year: %d\n", day);
		        printf("Remaining days: %d\n", 366 - day);

		        {

		        {
		            printf("Day of the year: %d\n", day);
		            printf("Remaining days: %d\n", 365 - day);
